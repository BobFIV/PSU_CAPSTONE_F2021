# oneM2M irrigation system using Nordic Thingy:91
PSU Capstone Fall 2021 Project

This is the arduino program that takes an voltage input from the Nordic Thingy:91 and uses that to send a 5v signal to activate the relay to activate the valve.
It functions the exact same as a comparator opamp - and will be replaced with a circuit in later versions of the project.
  This is more of a proof of concept that the oneM2M functionality is in place and something can be controlled
